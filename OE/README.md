# Fork of the LFP viewer 

The original can be found inside the pluginGUI repository : https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-GUI
in the folder plugins. 

The idea is to modify this plugin to accomodate the particular need of the probe developped by the Haesler lab. 

- Change the skip parameter in an average parameters 

## Plan for the future 

- Display channels along the axis x too (the probe is a rectangle)
- When clicking on one channel, expand and display all the averaged channels 
- add the drawing probe on the side to move along it instead of scrolling
